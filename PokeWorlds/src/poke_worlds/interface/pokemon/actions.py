    Base class for movement actions in the Pokemon environment.

    Is Valid When:

    Action Success Interpretation:
    - -1: Frame did not change, even on the first step
    - 0: Finished all steps
    - 1: Took some steps, but not all, and then frame stopped changing OR the frame starts oscillating (trying to check for jitter). This usually means we ran into an obstacle.
    - 2: Took some steps, but agent state changed from free roam. This often means we entered a cutscene or battle.

    Action Returns:
    - `n_steps_taken` (`int`): Number of steps actually taken
    - `rotated` (`bool` or `None`): True if the player has not moved, but has rotated. If the player has moved, this will be None. If it is False, it means the player tried to walk straight into an obstacle.

    Known Limitations:
    - Struggles to handle oscillating frames when the player is next to an obstacle. So if you are surrounded by water or bouncing flowers on all quadrants (e.g. the pier in Cinnabar Island), the system will think that the agent has moved forward, even though it has not.

    - 1: Took some steps, but not all, and then frame stopped changing OR the frame starts oscillating (trying to check for jitter). This usually means we ran into an obstacle.
    - 2: Took some steps, but agent state changed from free roam. This often means we entered a cutscene or battle.

    Action Returns:
    - `n_steps_taken` (`int`): Number of steps actually taken
    - `rotated` (`bool` or `None`): True if the player has not moved, but has rotated. If the player has moved, this will be None. If it is False, it means the player tried to walk straight into an obstacle.
